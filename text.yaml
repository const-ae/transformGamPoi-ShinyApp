general: >
  We compared the performance of 22 transformations, grouped into four approaches, for their ability to accurately transform the counts of RNA-seq single-cell experiments.
  We conducted three benchmarks that measure the consistency of the results, the recovery of the ground truth from simulated data, and the agreement of the k-nearest neighbor graph inferred from deeply sequenced data with a down-sampled view of the data.

benchmark_results: >
  A scatter plot of the k-NN overlap for each of the 22 transformations (grouped into four approaches) plus two negative controls. The colored points show the mean per transformation and overdispersion (shape of the colored marker). The lightly shaded points show the underlying replicates.
  In addition to the k-NN overlap, you can display the adjusted mutual information (AMI), adjusted Rand index (ARI), and normalized mutual information (NMI) for the simulation datasets by clicking the gear in the top left corner and selecting the corresponding option.
  The dataset, overdispersion, k-NN, and PCA picker select and filter individual aspects of the benchmark results.

contrasts: >
  A scatter plot comparing the performance of two selected transformations. By default, the plot displays the absolute k-NN overlap. For the dataset aggregations ("All consistency", "All downsampling", "All simulation") the relative view can be more informative (click the gear in the top right corner and check "zoom in" and "relative k-NN").
   The dataset, k-NN, and PCA picker select and filter individual aspects of the benchmark results.

computational_expenses: >
  A scatter plot of the CPU and elapsed time for all transformations on a logarithmic scale.
  The dataset, overdispersion, k-NN, and PCA picker select and filter individual aspects of the benchmark results.

datasets: >
  A reduced dimension scatter plot (PCA or tSNE) of the cells for all datasets colored by sequencing depth or cluster.
